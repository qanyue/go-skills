# Contributing

This repository publishes six [Agent Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) for Go as a Claude Code marketplace. A contribution is usually one of:

- a new skill,
- a fix or expansion to an existing skill's `SKILL.md`,
- a change to the catalog metadata.

Every rule below is enforced by CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`). If a rule is not in this document, CI does not check it; if it is in this document, CI fails the build when you break it.

## Repository shape

One directory per skill at the repository root. Each directory is a single-skill Claude Code plugin:

```text
<skill>/
  SKILL.md
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
```

- `SKILL.md` sits at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`. Claude Code takes the invocation name from the frontmatter `name`.
- The catalog-level `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists every skill. The six skill directories and the six marketplace entries must correspond one to one — no orphan directories, no entries pointing at missing directories.
- `templates/` is scaffold, not a skill; it is excluded from the correspondence check.
- The skills table in `README.md` lists every skill exactly once, each row linking to `./<skill>/SKILL.md`.

## Manifest contract

`<skill>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the **single source of truth** for a skill's display metadata: `name`, `displayName`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords`.

The matching `marketplace.json` entry carries **exactly four keys**:

```json
{ "name": "<skill>", "source": "./<skill>", "category": "<taxonomy>", "tags": ["..."] }
```

Do not repeat `description`, `version`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, or `keywords` in the entry. Claude Code reads them from `plugin.json`, and duplicated copies drift out of sync.

`name` must equal the directory name and `plugin.json.name`.

## Category taxonomy

`category` must be exactly one of `languages`, `development`, `frameworks`. Choose by what the skill teaches:

| Category | Use when the skill teaches | Currently |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `languages` | the Go language itself | `go`, `cobra-viper` |
| `development` | an engineering workflow or practice | `go-spec-reviewer`, `go-release`, `fileflow-pathologize` |
| `frameworks` | a third-party framework or runtime | `wails` |

## Tags

An entry's `tags` must equal its `plugin.json` `keywords` as a set. They are the same list written once.

## SKILL.md

Frontmatter requires `name` and `description`.

- `name` must equal the skill directory name and `plugin.json.name`.
- `description` is what drives model-invoked triggering. It must name the concrete contexts, file types, and phrases a user would actually say, and be at least 40 characters long. Past that bar, quality is judged in review — every current skill is a worked example.

## Versioning and release

The catalog carries **one version across all six plugins**. They move together; there is no per-skill version.

To cut a release:

1. Set `version` in every `<skill>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to the same new value.
2. Add a matching entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commit, then create an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` on that commit.

CI asserts that all six versions are identical, that a commit tagged `vX.Y.Z` carries version `X.Y.Z`, that the version is never behind the latest existing tag, and that `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry for it. A version-bump pull request therefore passes before the tag exists; the tagged commit is what must match exactly.

## Run the checks locally

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user jsonschema

# 1. Manifests validate against the published schemastore schemas
python3 .github/scripts/validate_manifests.py

# 2. Cross-file invariants (the rules in this document)
python3 .github/scripts/check_invariants.py

# 3. Links in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md resolve
lychee README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
```

## Adding a new skill

1. Copy the scaffold: `cp -r templates/skill <your-skill>`.
2. Fill in `SKILL.md` — frontmatter `name`/`description` first, then the guidance.
3. Fill in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Set `version` to the catalog's current version — the scaffold ships `0.0.0` as a placeholder, and CI rejects any version behind the latest `v*` tag, so a copied-and-ignored placeholder fails loudly.
4. Copy `templates/skill/marketplace-entry.json` into `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, replacing every placeholder. Keep the four keys.
5. Add a row to the skills table in `README.md`.
6. Run the three checks above.
